The bot is trained with intents, entities, and stories defined in the `data/` folder.

## Features
- Intent recognition and entity extraction
- Conversational flow with stories and rules
- Custom actions and responses
- Easy to extend with new intents and stories

## How to Run Your Rasa Chatbot

Follow these steps to set up and run the bot locally:

## Installation
**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/atuli93/rasa-chatbot.git
cd rasa-chatbot
```

**2. Set up a Python virtual environment.**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

**3. Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Train the Rasa model**
```bash
rasa train
```
- Models are stored locally in models/ and are not pushed to GitHub.


**5. Run the Bot**
- Chat in the terminal
```bash
rasa shell
```
- Run the Rasa server
```bash
rasa run
```
- Run custom actions (if any)
```bash
rasa run actions
```
- Test your bot
```bash
rasa test
```

ðŸ’¡ Tip: The models/ folder is ignored in Git. Every time you make changes to training data, run rasa train to generate an updated model.
